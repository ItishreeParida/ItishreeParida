                <p>Hi, I’m Itishree Parida and I recently completed my MCA from College of IT and Management Education. During my MCA, I’ve gained a strong understanding of languages like Java, Python, and C++, and have worked with databases like MySQL. I also have experience with web development technologies, data structures, and algorithms. I’ve developed a solid understanding of DSA, and I’m eager to apply these skills in a real-world setting.</p>
